# **Devops_project**

## This project Interact with following Tools
```
     1. Jenkins
     2. Docker
     3. kubernetes(EKS)
     4. MongoDB
     5. ReactJS
     6. Flask
```
> 1. **Jenkins:** Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

> 2. Docker: The docker is used to build, test and deploy the application quickly. In docker, we can quickly deplioy and scale application into any environment.

> 3. Kubernetes(EKS): EKS is a cloud based container mangement service that is natively used for deploy application. EKS service automatically manage and scaleble clustur of cloud services.

> 5. The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

> 6. Flask is used for developing web applications using python, implemented on Werkzeug and Jinja2. Advantages of using Flask framework are: There is a built-in development server and a fast debugger provided. Lightweight.
